Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com) Unit 1 Portfolio Exercise - jQuery app integrating with *Yelp*'s Open Platform API

##Background

I built this app drawing from a common argument that my wife and i always have when we are trying to decide where to go out to eat. This app will take a user's location, and style of food they like and find the 20 closest / best rated restaurants near you. The user then has the option to look through the results to pick a restaurant to go to, or click the choose for me button, to have the app randomly pick a restaurant for you to go to.

##Use Case

Why is this app useful? If you struggle with deciding on a place to eat, then why stress out over it, when you can let our app do the stressing for you. It takes away the hard decision of finding a place and leaves it up to fate.

##Initial UX

##Technical

The app is built entirely in jQuery and makes use of AJAX calls to *Yelp*'s Open Platform API to return the data. All data is held in memory during the user's session. It has been built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop screen resolutions.

##Development Roadmap

this is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:
